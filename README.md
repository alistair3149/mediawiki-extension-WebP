# WebP Extension
Upon file upload this extension creates a WebP (and Avif if active) version of the uploaded image and its thumbs.

Requires a working job queue, [Extension:PictureHtmlSupport](https://github.com/StarCitizenWiki/mediawiki-extensions-PictureHtmlSupport), and a usable version of `imagick`, `libwebp (cwebp)`, or `gd` installed.  
As well as `$wgHashedUploadDirectory = true;`, and if Extension:AWS is active `$wgAWSRepoHashLevels` to be `>0`;

Setting `$wgGenerateThumbnailOnParse = false;` is currently not supported.

## How does this work?
After an upload or file transformation, a transform job is dispatched that creates a webp (and avif if active) file version of the original file.  

Additionally, the PictureHtmlSupport extension exposes a hook when a thumbnail is added to the page output.  
Extension:WebP utilizes this hook to add a `<source>` element for each active image transformer.

## Converting already uploaded images
A maintenance script exists to convert already uploaded images:
```shell
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php

# To only convert non-thumbnails run
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php --no-thumbs

# To create thumbnails of custom sizes run
# This will create two thumbnails with size 1000px and 1250px
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php --thumb-sizes=1000,1250

# To only work on some images run
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php --titles=ImageA.jpg,ImageB.png

# To force the creation of already existing images run
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php --overwrite

# Only work on page titles matching a prefix
# Every page starting with prefix 'Example' will be selected
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php --title-prefix=Example

# Only work on page titles matching a file-type
# Every page starting with file-type 'png' will be selected
# Can be combined with 'title-prefix'
php extensions/WebP/maintenance/CreateFromLocalFiles.php --file-type=png
```

## Installation

```php
wfLoadExtension( 'WebP' );
```

### Enabling Avif
For full feature support you'll need to install Imagick v7, als v6.9 has multiple bugs.  
Alternatively you can install `libavif-bin` (>= 0.9.3) which provides `avifenc`. Do note that this still requires _a_ version of imagick installed, as avifenc can't rescale images.  

When enabling the Avif transformer, make sure that it is ordered before the webp transformer, as else the browser will pick the webp version.

```php
$wgEnabledTransformers = [ "MediaWiki\\Extension\\WebP\\Transformer\\AvifTransformer", "MediaWiki\\Extension\\WebP\\Transformer\\WebPTransformer" ];
```

## De-Installation
Delete the folders `images/webp` and `images/thumbs/webp` and remove the extension.  
If the Avif transformer is active remove `images/avif` and `images/thumbs/avif`.
